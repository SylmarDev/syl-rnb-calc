just notes for now

removed renderRangeForm I think it didn't need to exist

TODO:
- ~~make max health on range compare not editable~~
- Changing item on the range compare item dropdown updates it on the targets (if the target is the player)
- MOVE CHANGES (this is its own mini-epic :D)
    - ~~moves need to be stored in a list in window.RangeCompare, and displayed in a div somehow off to the right.~~
    - moves need to be stored either as an attack with all of its current field effects and attacker stats
    - there needs to be a button to add a custom move that takes a name, damage rolls, crit rate, and crit damage rolls aas parameters
    - I would make move one class that can represent either of those but do it however you think is best.
    - The move display to the right of the target, health, calc button.
- compare HP against HP value box won't accept a value in the negatives or any letters in the box
- the compare HP against submitbutton should have a style similar to .btn-range-add
- a resizer arrow. When user holds left mouse on it they can resize the range compare panel's height and width. It's current setting is the maximum

IMMEDIATE TODO:
keep working on making the moves show up to the right of the target info and above the chart.

// 10/18 TODO
- Make Copy put to right of list not left
- On target change recreate all move objects

# VERSION 2

*This is the document where I detail everything I want in version 2.0 of the Run and Bun Calc*

In no particular order right now:

Must haves:

- Security vulnerabilities fixed
- Notes underneath AI Options when a percentage is murky, or to disclaim when things may not show correctly
- HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE
- Boxes on top (CUSTOMIZABLE)
    - Guys remember what boxes they were in, update their sorting and etc in localstorage
- Crit rolls show alongside normal rolls, no more crit buttons (toggleable)
- Buttons for Poison tick, Burn tick, Sand tick, berry heal (toggleable)
- A way to keep track of how many people have used it, how many calcs have been done, what toggles people keep on, etc
- Suggestions/Bug reports
- Stat boosts horizontially along the top with -/+ controls
- Remove all items button from all mons, that exports them with item ``(none)``
- Range calculator (toggleable)


Nice to have:

- Name of boxes (of mons) can change, more boxes can be added
- Post KO Switch AI (toggleable)
- In between the two calcs show what the screen would look like
  - will require backsprites, etc
- Chart of what AI is likely to click next (toggleable)
- ~~Searchable trainer names~~
- ~~Plusle and Minun icons correctly show singles and doubles and can't be cheesed~~
